    "        # that we are going to be using 0 indexing in the list so I then created a variable that stored each index at \n",
    "        # the zero position so here is where I created a new variable called uppercase and in that variable what I did \n",
    "        # was that I got the zero index and ran the upper function on the it so if the word is cat its going to be \n",
    "        # Cat and the good news was that it was doing this to all the variable in the list this showed how using split \n",
    "        # had became so clutch and it had made life more easier because we can then work with each index and then caps \n",
    "        # them so the question that came to my mind was that what can I do here to replace each word here with the caps\n",

    "    # that is in the other code uts called RetailItem and the thing to know is that we are going to be creating an obj\n",
    "    # of this class and then store it into the CashRegister class so as you can see we created 4 objects each with its\n",
    "    # own different attributes from the name of the brand then the qty and then the price the program that we are going\n",
    "    # to be making is going to is going to be adding each of these objects to a list in the CashRegister and then its\n",
    "    # going to add the price its also going to be showing the items in this case when it comes to attributes and lastly\n",
    "    # its going to delete everything a method by itself so since I knew that we are going to be adding objects to a\n",
    "    # list the CashRegister class needs to have a list that is going to be stand by itself attribute that is going to\n",
    "    # get passed in the later methods the next thing that I did was that I created a method called purchase_item and\n",
    "    # its going to get each object and then add them to a list the thing that I had learned with this code was that at\n",
    "    # first I was thinking that if I import the module then I can use the objects directly rather that was not the case\n",
    "    # so instead what I had done was that I had gotten the class and basically wrote the other class underneath it so\n",
    "    # that way I can create the object directly the best part of this code is that when it comes to working with lists\n",
    "    # its something that I am more comfortable with and I basically added each object to the list and this was something\n",
    "    # that we had learned in the dict code and the thing was that we were adding an object to the dict using its key\n",
    "    # and value and now what we are doing is that we are adding to a list using the object itself and it can kind of\n",
    "    # show us how we can use object oriented to our approach where we store object to data types and then each of those\n",
    "    # objects are comprised of attributes so the whole purpose of an object is to store data type attributes so that\n",
    "    # you can access each of the attributes later on the display items was really simple all we did was run a loop\n",
    "    # through our object list and then get each object we already talked about how when it comes to printing an object\n",
    "    # value we need to make sure that we have the __str__ because its going to print the state of the object so that is\n",
    "    # really important to understand when you call print object by itself its not going to work like that so what we\n",

    "    # So lets break down what is happening here the very first thing that we need to know is what are we coding and why\n",
    "    # the goal of the program is to make a Trivia game for two players the first player is going to answer 5 questions\n",
    "    # and the second is going to be answering 5 questions as well there should be a total of 10 questions when a\n",
    "    # question is displayed then 4 possible answer choices are displayed and only one of the answer choice is correct\n",
    "    # if the player gets a correct answer choice then we are going to be adding it to our count after the answers are\n",
    "    # selected for all the program then displays the number of points and then the player with the highest point the\n",
    "    # winner we are going to be creating a Question class and its going to be holding the question and then the four\n",
    "    # possible answer choices the program should have a list or a dict containing 10 Question objects one for each\n",
    "    # question\n",
    "    # So lets begin with this code now the very first thing that I wanted to do was that I wanted to use a dict that\n",
    "    # was going to be harder choice for me because I really haven't been using dicts that much the very first thing that\n",
    "    # I was thinking was that how can I incorporate object oriented programming and also use dicts that was the very\n",
    "    # first thing that was on my mind the second thing was that I was thinking how am I going to be incorporating the\n",
    "    # objects into this like what is the objects going to reference that was something else that was on my mind so what\n",
    "    # I did was that I had created the Question class and in it I started with the __init__ and the first thing that\n",
    "    # I had done was that I put both the dict and the 4 answer choices inside but when I was creating the object it\n",
    "    # just seemed weird so what I had done instead was that I had gotten the 4 answer choices and then put those inside\n",

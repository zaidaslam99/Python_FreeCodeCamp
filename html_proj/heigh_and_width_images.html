<img src="kira_wallpaper.jpeg" alt="soda boku kira tha" width="300" height="400">

<!-- So earlier we talked about how to put a picture to the window and it 
	was really simple what we do is we put the pic in the same file and then 
	we save it we then can use a relative address so that we can access that pic 
	we talked about the src which is the address of where the file is or the file 
	if its in the same file and then alt is it describes the image if you cant 
	see it then we learn two new attributes which are width and height and they 
	are self explanatory something worth mentioning here is that the height and 
	width are basically the images in pixels meaning that how many pixels should 
	the image cover width and height wise

	images take longer to load then html code  -->

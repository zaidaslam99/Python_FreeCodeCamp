<!-- So earlier we talked about absolute url and now we are going 
	to be tallking about relative urls, when we are linking other pages 
	within the same site we dont have to use the website name for example
	in this code notice we are uing the same logic we have the same 
	<a href=" "></a> tag within the href tags instead of using the website name 
	where the webpage an we can use the html files that we created something 
	that I wanted to mention was that this is going to give us 4 different 
	text links and they are going to be linked to the html pages that we 
	created and the other thing that we need to mention here is that when we 
	click on the page it then goes forward instead of going to a new page 
	
	Something that I wanted to ellborate on here is that we are going to be 
	making pages within the pages that is an important concept to understand.
	something else that you need to know is that what makes relative URl different 
	from URl is that you dont need to specify the domain name. -->

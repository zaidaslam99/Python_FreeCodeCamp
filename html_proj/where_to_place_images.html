<!-- So now we are going to be learning about where to palce images in the code 
	the first tag as you can see we have our image tag outside of our p tag meaning 
	that image goes first then we have our paragraph the second tag does something 
	different where we are putting the image within our <p></p> tag and what makes 
	this different is that our paragraph is going to start with an image instead 
	of starting with a text so it will be our image first then our text the last 
	paragraph that we did was that there is our <p></p> tag and it starts with words in 
	the middle of the words we have our image then we have more words after the image. So 
	recap its going to be before a paragraph then inside a paragraph then in the middle 
	of the paragraph.

	where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements 
	in one of two ways block elements always appear on a new line something worth knowing here 
	is that examples of these include the <h1></h1> and <p></p> tags each time we were to use 
	these then they will start on a new line. So take a look at the first one the image is being put 
	first then we are using the <p></p> since p is a block element tag it means that its going 
	to be starting on a new block that is something important to consider when it comes to working 
	with this. 

	Now we are going to be talking about inline elements and what this means is that say if we 
	use the image and then we use the tags that means that the text is not going to jump to the 
	next line what this means is that the image will be placed then its gong to be the text or it
	going to be text and then image and then text so the key difference in understanding this is that 
	there are inline elements and block elements and depending on them they examples of inline elements 
	is <em> </em> <img src=""> <b></b> that why in the second and third instance the pic is first then words 
	and the last its words pic words.-->

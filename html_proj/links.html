<!-- So in our earlier code we were linking the link text 
	to pages by using the file paths something that I wanted to 
	cover in this code was that we can use the href and then link 
	a person emal to the link text this shows us that we can use the 
	href for both pages and then email something else that you need 
	to know is that this is going to be sending an email to the address
	that is linked in the mailto.

	Something that I watned to cover was that when it comes to this code is
	that notice that there is a mailto attribute that we are using in the 
	other code we had the href="pageaddress" and here we are passing mailto 
	attribute so in other words its almost as if we are passing an attribute within 
	an attribute that is something important to consider when writting this code.-->

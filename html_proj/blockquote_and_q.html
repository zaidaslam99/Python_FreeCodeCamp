<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
	Winnie-the-Pooh">
	<p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start
		again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As A.A Milne said. <q>Some people talk to
	animals. Not many listen though. That's the 
	problem.</q></p>


<!--Something to know when it comes to <blockquote> </blockquote> and <q> </q>
	is that this is used for quotations the blockquote element is used for longer quotes
	that take up entire paragrpah Notice how the <p> </p> element is still in the 
	blockquote the broswer tend to indent the content of a blockquote this doesnt 
	mean that you should use this strictly for indenting rather you use css for that.
	The important thing to understand is this that this will indent the contents of an
	element. Something that you need to know is that the <p> </p> element is still within 
	the <blockquote> </blockquote> another thing that you need to know is that when it 
	comes to the blockquote its not completley shut meaning that we leave the tag open we 
	then put the <p> </p> tag and this indents what we are trying to write. Another thing 
	that you need to know is tahtwe are using a key and a variable that is going by the 
	blockquote in this case its going to be cite= and its putting the name of the website. 

	The <q> </q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph many people 
	avoid using this because internet explor doenst allow it. Both element used the cite 
	attribute to indicate where the quote is from and its value should have more info about
	the source of the quotation.-->

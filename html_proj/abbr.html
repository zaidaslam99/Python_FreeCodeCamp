<p><abbr title="Professor"> Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking

<!-- So here we are learning about the <abbr> </abbr> tag and 
	the thing to know here is that notice that we are putting
	a key and for our key when it comes to <abbr> we use the title
	key and then we fill it with its value something that I wanted 
	to highlight was that when it comes to the tags its within the 
	tag so within the < > of the abbr we are using title and this is
	going to be giving us more details about the tag and what it stands
	for. -->

<!-- Something else that I wanted to mention was that the <acronym> </acronym>
	tag is doing the same thing as the abbr tag the only thing that you need 
	to know when it comes to this code is that acronym is used in html4 were 
	you can spell the whole thing out and the other thing to now is that notice
	the format the <p> then its going to be <abbr _(key_and_value)__>  what 
	we want to abberivate </abbr> rest of the paragraph</p> The title is going 
	to specify the full term that is something important to consider when it 
	comes to this code. -->

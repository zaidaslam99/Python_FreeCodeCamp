<!-- Unordered lists are list that begin with a bullet 
	point rather than characters that indicate order. Something 
	else worth knowing is that unordered list are created with the
	<ul> </ul> element and each item is put in the <li> </li> tag and
	the browser indents list by default something that I wanted to point 
	out here is that we specify what list we want and then we simply 
	put the list element within it. Say if you wanted to change the list 
	element to specify a circle, square, diamonds you will use css and this we 
	will talk about later.-->

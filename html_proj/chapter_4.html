<!-- So lets break down what is happening here notice the very first thing 
	that we did was that we created a title tag and then after that we had
	created the <h1> </h1> tag and there we gave it an id attribute  we then went 
	and created a <h2></h2> tag and then a <p></p> tag something that I wanted to 
	mention when it comes to the <p></p> tag was that we put an <a href=""></a> which 
	was going to get the mailto attribute something else that I wanted to mention was 
	that we had the Contact US text link and this linked the email address to the text 
	we then had an another head something that you want to know when it comes to putting 
	text hyper link in the paragraph is that when the user is going to be writting then 
	its going to have a text link where when the person clicks on the text it then goes
	to the link that we specify the next thing that we are going to be talking about is 
	that we used the <a href=""></a> and provided an href address so when the user clicks 
	on the text word it then goes to that link that is something to consider we then used
	break statement and then we used the h3 tag which then gave us another heading and then
	we started another p tag which then started an a tag and we gave a page address of html
	if the user clicks on the page and this goes back to staying on the same page or going to 
	another link this is something that we covered the next thing that we did was that we used 
	the href to link it with the top of the page in this case the header because there we had a 
	id attribute that we then linked using the href #top that is something important to 
	understand.

	So the thing to take away here is this that when we are working with here is that we can 
	use the href attribute where we can put the mailto address and then we can use the href 
	attribute where we can link it to another page or then link it to a page within a page and 
	we can also use this to link it to the top of a page where we can use the header and we also 
	have to use the # in the <a href=""></a> -->

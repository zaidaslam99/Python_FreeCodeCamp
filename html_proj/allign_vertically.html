<!-- So this is the old scool way of doing things but its really simple 
	to understand first thing to know is that this way is rather outdated meaning 
	that its not commonly in practie but notice what we did here where we have the 
	<p></p> tag then we have the align and we but where we want to align if its in 
	top middle or bottom aside from that its important to understand that nothing
	really changes here what this means is that we have our picture and then our text 
	is either going to start at the top of the picture or in the middle or in the bottom 
	the value top places the first line of text near the top of the image and the reamining
	lines appear under the image the value of middle places the first line of text in the 
	middle of the image and subsquent lines of text appear under the image the value bottom 
	places the first line of text near the bottom of the iamge and subsequent lines of text 
	under the image its important  -->

<p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen 
	Hawking has sold over then million copies worldwide.</p>

<!-- Here there is really not much to go over but the idea that 
	we are using the cite tag and then we are going to be citing where 
	we got our information from something else to know is that this is going

	not be used for name but most people do that in html4 therefore they continue to
	use it  -->

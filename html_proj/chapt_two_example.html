	<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p>Molly had been staring out her window for about 
		an hour now, On her desk, lying between the copies
		of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other 
		scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well 
		thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's
		favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four
		walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
	<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster
		with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of 
		people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many consider her 
		pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr 
		title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding 
		achievement. Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.

<!-- So here in this code notice that for our title we chose Text this is goig to be 
	the window name the second thing that we did was that we used <h1></h1> and then 
	<h2> </h2> tags after that we started our <p> </p> tags and then we kept writting 
	and we used our <i> italics</i> tag this added empahsis on our reading we then used 
	a cite tag where we wrote a name of a book we then added a quote tag and the thing 
	to know is that this added a quote we then added an abbrievation and put in a 
	abbrievation using the title and its value and then we wrote the word to what it is 
	going to be abberiveted when someone clicks on it and then we finsied it with an em 
	tag that puts emphasis on something so it can be used in another way once that was done
	we closed the paragraph tag and then the body tag and the html tag-->

<img src="kira_wallpaper.jpeg" alt="A character from death note"
	title="He is a really smart character" />

<!-- So this was a revolutionary code for me because this was something 
	that I was struggling in here and the thing that I learned in this 
	code was file paths the first thing that I wanted to address was that 
	the directory that we are going to be using is going to be on our 
	desktop within the desktop I put the index.html where this is then 
	we can load our picture in it I stored a pic called kira_wallpaper.jpeg
	and the thing to know here is that I was making a mistake in the spelling
	instead of using .jpeg I was using .jpg and that was wrong as you can see 
	I put a relative file path and stored the kira_wallpaper.jpeg and it then 
	displayed that image.

	So when it comes to working with images we use the <img src=""> tag and the 
	thing to know here is that you can see three things src then alt and then title 
	these are 3 attributes when it comes to working with images the first thing that 
	to add an image to a page you can use the image element something worth knowing 
	is that since there is no closing tag that means that its an empty element. 

	The next thing that we are going to be talking about is the src and this is going 
	to tell the browser where we can find the image file this will be a relative URL 
	that will pointing to an image on your own site this is where our knowledge of 
	directories comes into play here in our desktop we created an html file and then 
	we saved all of our sublime text file and then because it had the index.html what 
	we can then do is use the name of the image because it is using a relative address.

	The next thing that we are going to be talking about is the alt attribute this provides 
	a text description of the image if you cant see it 

	After that we are going to be talking about title attrubute which we can use alongside the 
	image tag this provides additional information about the image this item is displayed in the 
	tooltip this means that when we hover over the image then it shows what is written in this 
	attribute the text that is written in the alt attribute is known as an alt text it gives an 
	accurate description of the image content so it can be understood by screen reader software 
	used by visual impariment and the search engines suppose if the image is there just so for 
	attractvness then the alt attribute should still be used and the quotation should be left 
	blank-->

	<!-- So here we are learning about alligning pictures the thing that we need to know here 
		is that its really simple to everything that we have done where we get the width and then
		the height and then all we are doing is that we are using the align attribute which is 
		going to either align the pic to the left or the right some general notes the align 
		attribute was used to indicate how the other parts of the page should flow around the image 
		something to understand is that align has been removed from HTML5 and you should use CSS to 
		control how to align a page some coders still use this practice its important not to get 
		confused when it comes to working with this the other thing to understand is that left means
		that align the image to the left allowing the text to be on the right and right means the 
		inverse of it  this looks a lot neater then having one line of text next to the other when 
		you are giving the align attribute left that means that the image should be on the left and 
		inverse of it  -->

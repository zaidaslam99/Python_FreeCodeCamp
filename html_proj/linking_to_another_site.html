<!-- So now we are going to be learning about links and the first 
	thing to know is that links are created using the <a href=""></a> element
	within it as you can see there is a href tag the href tag is the page the 
	link takes you to and the text that the user clicks on is known as a link text
	so as you can see the href attribute we have the link earlier we had done the 
	<a href=""> </a> tag but I wasnt to sure what it did the important thing to 
	understand here is that the href parameter is going in the a tag and then that 
	is repsonisble for the link and within the middle is going to be the text which 
	is going to take us to the link.
	Now we learn about a term as the absoulte URL and this is when you click on a page 
	and it takes you to that page so in essence that page overrides the current page that 
	you were in and this is known as the absoulte URL. The important thing to understand here 
	is that we are linking to another site this means that we are going from one page to another  -->

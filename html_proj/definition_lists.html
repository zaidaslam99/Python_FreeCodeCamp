<!-- So this is known as a definition lists and they are made of 
	set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. So the 
	very first thing that I made a mistake on was that instead of <dl> </dl>
	which stands for defintion list what I was doing was that I was using <d1>
	and that is not the case. The <dl> is created with <dt> </dt> and <dd> </dd>
	<dt> is used for the term being defined and <dd> contains the definition. 
	Sometimes the term can have two words and one defintion or it can have two terms 
	and one defintion (dont always have to be 2 can be more as well) that is an important
	point to consider. Another thing to understand is that we are putting the term 
	and defintion within the defintion list tag so we create it like a sandwhich where 
	instead of putting list elements we put the term tag and defintion tag that is 
	also an important point to consider when it comes to this code  -->

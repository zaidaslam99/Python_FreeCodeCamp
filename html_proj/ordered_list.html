<!-- In html we use ordered list where each item in the list is numbered 
	where the list can be set of steps this program that we wrote gives us to 
	to make something by giving us a series of steps. The second thing to 
	know is that the ordered list is used with the <ol> </ol> element and this 
	stands for ordered lists and when it comes to <li> </li> tags this stands 
	for each list element. Something else to know is the browser indents the list 
	elements. Another thing you want to know is that sometimes you want to change the
	list to have alphabets, roman numerals, etc.. you can achieve this result by 
	using css. -->

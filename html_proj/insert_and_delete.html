<p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea she had ever had.</p>

<!-- Here the code is really simple to understand notice we are saying at 
	first it was the worst and then we del the worst and then for the insert 
	we put best in its place and it scracthes out worst and then puts best with 
	an underline something that I had learned when it comes to this code is spacing 
	its best to write the words in the tags and then the surrounding sentece you can 
	then put spacing in it. -->

<!-- This is what is known as nested lists and the way to do 
	a nested list is to put another <li> </li> tag within the 
	<li> </li> tag  so if you look at this code you can see the 
	very first <Li> tag that we have and that is going to be a 
	list element now if you look at the <li> for Pastries notice
	that wihtin it we have another <ul> tag now there is something 
	important to understand and that is we are using an unordered list
	because <ul> tags are something we have worked with and within the 
	<ul> tags we have list element tags and the best way to think is that 
	each of these tags will have thier own meta tag so what you are saying 
	is tat for Crossant we want more tags within tags the important thing 
	to also know is that browser displays nested lists indented further than
	the parent list in nested unordered lists the browser will usually change 
	the style of the bullet point to. -->

<!-- So now we are going to be leanring about how to link to a 
	specific part of the same page and to understand one might think
	what does that mean? the answer to that is really simple we create a page 
	where when we click on a link then it takes us to that page now the logic to 
	understand here is tat we are using the id attribute in the header tag so notice 
	in our for <h1 id=""> </h1> notice how there is an id attribute that is written 
	here the second next thing that we are going to make is an text link and we use that 
	using the. <a href=""></a> something that I wnated to mention when it comes to href 
	is that notice how the href starts with # symbol that is the most important part to 
	understand when it comes to this code that we are using the href value that is going to 
	be using an # starting and then the name is going to link to the id that we want to get 
	to
	
	Now one might think I understand those concepts but its important to understand which tags 
	are helping us do this the first being that we are using an text link shot and the second being 
	that we are using <h2> so its important to understand that in our h2 shot we use the id attribute 
	and then use that id attribute to communicate with our href using our hyper link text and then 
	that links the section to the text link the other thing thing is that there is really no order you can 
	either create the hyper link text first and then the Header or you can create the header and then 
	link to to the text the first line we create a Header and then we gave that header an id we then 
	went and created an hyperlink text and used that id using the # sign and each time we click the link
	we then go to that sign.

	Now when it comes to linking to a specific part of another page and we use the same logic as long 
	as there is an id attribute that identifys specific parts of the page you can add the syntax 
	to the end of the link of the page the href will contain the the address for the page either an
	absolute URL or a relative URL followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element
	that you are linking to. <a href="htttp:/www.htmlandcssbook.com/#bottom"></a> so notice we put the 
	link and then we used the -->

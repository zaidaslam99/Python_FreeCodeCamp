<!-- So here we are going to be learning about the <<address> </address> element
	the first thing to know is that the address element contains contact details 
	for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address though it does 
	not have to, it may contain a phone address or an email address browser display 
	the content of the address in italics -->

<!-- Right off the bat the. first thing that I notice about this code first we are 
	starting with the <address> and within it we have our <p> paragrpah tags 
	within that we have our <a href=""></a></p></address> Something to consider is that
	the href has more info about who to mailto as the key and the value is an email
	and then within our <a> tag we have our email we dont really cover the <a> tag and 
	what it stands for but something worth knowing is that our address is going to be 
	giving more details about our author and within it we have our <a href=""></a> where 
	we put the key mailto:value and then the email something to know is that the <a> 
	it makes a hyperlink and then second one it italics the address -->

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2 eggs</li>
		<li>1tbs butter</li>
		<li>2tbs cream</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Method</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium
			heat</li>
		<li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
		<li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
		<li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of 
			the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you

<!-- So our title or the name of the tab is called lists and within it 
	we have <h1> tags and then the <p> tags then we have our <h2> tags and notice
	right after that we have our unordered list this is going to be in bullet points 
	that is something important to consider we then start the <ul> tags and then we 
	put 3 <li> elements within the tag and that is going to be the list of stuff
	we then close the </ul> tags and for our <h2> tag we write the name of the title 
	and this is going to be method and we want it to have ordered numbers such as set 
	of instructions on how to make it something that just came to my mind is ul tags we
	can use to just specify what we need and then ol tags we can specify the steps and then 
	we label each step using the <li> tags notice we dont do any nesting list this is a very simple
	program that teachs how to use these different list munipulation technique. -->
